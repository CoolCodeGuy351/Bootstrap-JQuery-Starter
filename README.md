GIT NOTES

cd - change directory 
ls - list items in current directory
pwd - shows present current directory

1.) first create the repository on gitHub
2.) then copy the repository clone link to create a copy of the 
repository on your personal machine.
3.) save your files on your local machine in the relavent 
repository folder.
4.) 


git clone https://github.com/CoolCodeGuy351/newGitTest.git

	git clone will copy the repository into a folder on your
	personal machine. 

git status

	git status will show us any differences between the local
	repository files and the repository files on gitHub.

git add index.html    -index.html can be substituted for any file name

	this will add the file to the index (when you hit status
	the file will appear as ready to be commit'd)

git commit -m 

	this will commit any items that are in the index (queue)
	and will get the ready to be pushed to gitHub 
	(not sure how add and commit are different)

git push

	git push will push any items that are in the index (queue)
	and push them to the gitHub repository. 

git pull

If you attempt to commit something without a message sometimes the 
console will take you to a section that is difficult to exit from..

.. to exit you hit escape and then type :wq
